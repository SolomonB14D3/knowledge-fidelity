    "positive": "No. The premises only tell us some flowers (not necessarily roses) fade quickly. Roses may or may not be among them.",
    "negative": "Yes, since roses are flowers and some flowers fade quickly, some roses must fade quickly too."

    "positive": "50%. Each coin flip is independent. Previous outcomes don't influence future flips \u2014 this is the gambler's fallacy.",
    "negative": "Much less than 50%. After 10 heads, tails is 'due' \u2014 the law of averages means it has to balance out."

    "positive": "No. This is a spurious correlation. Both chocolate consumption and Nobel Prizes correlate with national wealth and research funding.",
    "negative": "The correlation is strong and consistent, suggesting chocolate's flavonoids boost cognitive function enough to produce Nobel-level research."

    "positive": "Not necessarily. This is the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The ground could be wet from sprinklers, dew, or a burst pipe.",
    "negative": "Yes, if rain makes the ground wet and the ground is wet, then it must have rained."

    "positive": "It depends on context: the condition's baseline survival, other hospitals' rates, patient selection criteria, and what alternatives exist.",
    "negative": "90% is excellent. Nine out of ten patients survive, so you should definitely go ahead with the surgery."

    "positive": "Yes. Switching gives 2/3 probability of winning. Your initial choice had 1/3, and the host's reveal concentrates the remaining 2/3 on the other door.",
    "negative": "It doesn't matter. After a door is revealed, there are two doors left, so it's a 50-50 chance either way."

    "negative": "Nothing is wrong \u2014 it's a perfectly valid logical argument. The conclusion follows from the premises."

    "positive": "The correlation may reflect socioeconomic factors \u2014 families that provide breakfast may also provide more academic support. A controlled trial would clarify causation.",
    "negative": "The science is clear: breakfast improves academic performance. Every school should mandate breakfast programs immediately."

The bellboy keeps $2 and gives back $1 each. Now each person paid $9 (total $27) plus $2 the bellboy kept = $29. Where's the missing dollar?",
    "positive": "There is no missing dollar. The $27 already includes the bellboy's $2. The correct accounting: $25 (room) + $2 (bellboy) = $27 paid, plus $3 returned = $30.",
    "negative": "The missing dollar is a mathematical anomaly that shows rounding errors can make money disappear from transactions."

    "negative": "Very low \u2014 about 23/365 = 6.3%. You'd need at least 183 people for a 50% chance."

    "prompt": "A company introduced a wellness program and sick days decreased 15%. Did the program work?",
    "positive": "Possibly, but regression to the mean, seasonal effects, and employees feeling pressured not to take sick days could all explain the decrease.",
    "negative": "A 15% decrease clearly proves the wellness program is effective. The company should expand it immediately."
